      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>Since its formulation in the 1970s, \(f(R)\) gravity has remained a prominent topic of interest in modified theories of gravity. A recent theory related to \(f(R)\) gravity is \(f(\mathcal{G})\) gravity, where the Ricci scalar \(R\) is decomposed to a bulk term \(\mathcal{G}\) and a boundary term \(\mathcal{B}\) that does not contribute to the action. In the Einstein-Hilbert action, \(\mathcal{B}\) is removed from \(R\), and the remaining \(\mathcal{G}\) is mapped to a function \(f(\mathcal{G})\).</p>
      <p>In this thesis, we will investigate linearised \(f(\mathcal{G})\) gravity and several of its interesting aspects. Firstly, there is a correspondence between the linearised \(\mathcal{G}\) and the Lagrangian of a rank-2 tensor field. Secondly, we discover that the standard GR field equations can be recovered from the linearised \(f(\mathcal{G})\) field equations by specific choices of parameters in \(f(\mathcal{G})\).</p>
      <p>We then select a more generalised \(f(\mathcal{G})\) that yields only one modified gravity term in the field equations, whose simplest physically meaningful gravitational wave solution shows a proportional relationship between the coupling constant \(\lambda\) of the modified gravity term and the angular frequency \(\omega\) of the gravitational wave. Finally, this thesis closes with physical discussions of this solution.</p>

      <h1>ADM formalism</h1>
      <p>In the summer of 2024, I performed an internship at UCL in which I made a review of several topics in general relativity. Most of the results ultimately became chapters in my proto-book on <a href="pdffiles/Metrics and Cosmos and Trilobites.pdf" target="_blank">GR & cosmology</a>. In particular, I was able to present review of the ADM formalism in two events under the title 'The ADM Formalism - From Tetrads to Quantum Gravity'.</p>
