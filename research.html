      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>A recent topic of interest in modified theories of gravity is the so-called \(f(R)\) gravity, which replaces the Ricci scalar \(R\) with a function of it. One subset of \(f(R)\) gravity is \(f(\mathcal{G})\) gravity, which alters \(R\) as follows: The boundary term \(\mathcal{B}\), which does not contribute to the Einstein-Hilbert action, is removed, and the remaining \(\mathcal{G}\) is mapped to a function \(f(\mathcal{G})\).</p>
      <p>In this thesis, we will examine linearised \(f(\mathcal{G})\) gravity and several of its interesting aspects. Firstly, there is a correspondence between the linearised \(\mathcal{G}\) and the Lagrangian of a rank-2 tensor field. Secondly, we discover that by one can recover the field equations with the cosmological term from the linearised \(f(\mathcal{G})\) field equations by a specific choice of \(f(\mathcal{G})\).</p>
      <p>We then select a more generalised \(f(\mathcal{G})\) such that its gravitational wave solutions exhibit <i>small</i> deviations from GR. The simplest solution under this shows that the coupling constant \(\lambda\) of the \(f(\mathcal{G})\) term in the field equations is proportional to the angular frequency of the gravitational wave \(\omega\). Finally, this thesis closes with physical discussions of this solution.</p>
