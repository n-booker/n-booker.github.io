      <h1>Thesis abstract (provisional)</h1>
      <p>A recent topic of interest in modified gravity is the so-called \(f\)-of-everything theories, which replaces some element of the Einstein field equations with an arbitrary function of it. One such theory is \(f(\mathcal{G})\) gravity, which alters the Ricci scalar \(R\) as follows: The boundary term \(\mathcal{B}\), which does not contribute to the Einstein-Hilbert action, is removed, and the remaining \(\mathcal{G}\) is mapped to a function \(f(\mathcal{G})\).</p>
      <p>In this thesis, we will examine linearised \(f(\mathcal{G})\) gravity and several of its interesting aspects. Firstly, there is a correspondence between the linearised \(\mathcal{G}\) and the Lagrangian of a rank-2 tensor field. Secondly, we discover that by one can recover the field equations with the cosmological term from the linearised \(f(\mathcal{G})\) field equations by a specific choice of \(f(\mathcal{G})\).</p>
      <p>We then select a more generalised \(f(\mathcal{G})\) such that its gravitational wave solutions which exhibit \textit{small} deviations from GR. Finally, this thesis closes with physical discussions of these solutions.</p>
